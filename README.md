Sprint retrospective  Dataman
------------------------------
What went well in this sprint?:I got to work on the last feature which is  guessing a number. In total, we have three features login , math game, and a guessing program. 
What did not go well in this sprint?: We still have a little trouble connecting the running  code from the github pages. We both worked on the flaskr blog in the last module . The flaskr blog is a ideal flask web app. It has all of the working components. We have all three backend python files working but the frontend is where we kind of have trouble with. I guess you can say connecting all of it  together 
What improvements can be made?: In class, we got to look at one of the past capstone projects and got an idea of how the database can look. In the future, we would like to implement a working database as well as the frontend.
